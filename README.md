# 🎙️ Deepfake Audio Detection

This is a simple Python application that detects whether an audio file is **real** or **AI-generated (deepfake)** using machine learning.

The project uses:
- 🎛️ MFCC feature extraction via `librosa`
- 🌲 Random Forest classifier for training
- 🧪 Separate training, testing, and validation datasets
- 🖥️ A friendly Tkinter GUI (coming soon!)
